# BinaryGame

This program is a binary game in the vein of Sudoku, but using only 1's and 0's. The goal of the game is to fill out the grid using only
these numbers while respecting the three following rules:

1. The same number cannot appears more than twice in a row in any given row or column, meaning for example that you cannot for have
   000 or 111 in any of the rows or columns of the grid.
   
2. Each row and column must have the same number of 1's and 0's. For example, for a 10x10 grid you would need to have exactly five 1's and
   five 0's in each row and column.
   
3. When the grid is completely filled, there must not be two rows that are identical or two columns that are identical.

*To run the game using the Binairo.jar file you also need to have the "Language files" and "Images" folder in the same folder as the .jar file.
